# TEST CASE
#
# if the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words
# eg. one, two, three, four, five
# the letters used in total == 19
#
# print('\n')
# print(total_letters_in_range(1, 5))
#
# expected output:
# 19


# if all numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) were written out in words
# how many letters would be used?

# spaces or hyphens do not count
# eg. 342, three hundred and forty two contains 23 letters
# eg. 115, one hundred and fifteen contains 20 letters
# the 'and' is used in compliance with british usage

# print('\n')
# print('if all nubmers from 1 to 1000 were written out in words, how many letters would be used')
# print(total_letters_in_range(1, 1000))
