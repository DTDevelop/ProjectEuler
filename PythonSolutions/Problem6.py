# the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 1**2 + 2**2 + .. + 10**2 = 385

# the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1 + 2 + .. + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025

# hence the difference between the sum of the squares
# of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the
# sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640

# find the difference between the sum of
# the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers
# and the square of the sum
